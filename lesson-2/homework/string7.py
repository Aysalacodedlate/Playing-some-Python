#Ask the user to input a sentence and a word to replace. Replace that word with another word provided by the user.
sentc = input("What do you like?")
sentc2 = input("What else?")
print(f"I like {sentc2} ")

#I could not understand the logic of this problem so it might look meaningless. 
#How do I know which word should I replace from the input?
#Ya'ni won't the grammar go wrong instantly?
